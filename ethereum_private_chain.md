# Why did it fail?!

## Ethereum

### Goal
Let's build a private ethereum chain which only our defined nodes connect to

### Setup
- geth-alltools-linux-386-1.6.0-facc47cb
- DigitalOcean 5$ debian boxes and a local machine

### Private Chain

#### Nodes don't connect

##### Never let your nodes connect to the public ethereum network!
- Run geth with *--nodiscover* flag.   
- If a node does connect to the public network, it's database is most likeley 'polluted.   
- Delelte it and start clean. (rm -r ~/.ethereum)   

##### The private chain is defined by the so called genesis block.
- Every node has to be initialized with this genesis block, so it knows where the chain starts.
- The genesis block can be generated using a genesis.json file and the command `geth init genesis.json`
- Make sure that the genesis.json file you use on your nodes is EXACTLY the same. If it isn't, your nodes won't connect!
- Make up some random number for your networkid. E.g. 1234
- Verify by checking the genesis block hash and network id from the geth javascript console by logging in to the console:
`geth --networkid 1234 --nodiscover console` and then running: `admin.nodeInfo.protocols.eth`
- (You can exit the console with 'exit' ... who would have thought ;) )

*genesis.json*   
```
  {
    "config": {
        "chainId": 2217,
        "homesteadBlock": 0,
        "eip155Block": 0,
        "eip158Block": 0
    },
    "difficulty": "0x00400",
    "gasLimit": "2100000",
    "alloc": {
        "4b86b43b798c527234998992165200f993d3e228": { "balance": "10000000000000000000" },
        "f41c74c9ae680c1aa78f42e5647a62f353b7bdde": { "balance": "400000" }
    }
}
```

##### Autodiscovery of the nodes using the `bootnode` tool didn't work
- Start simple and manually connect the nodes
- Find out the enode id of the node you want to connect to:
- Run `admin.nodeInfo.enode` inside geth's javascript console:

`"enode://750ade65e0f208aa48d9314306fe6d66ec26f83cff39ee9fbf710c1f8398b5357e2c272f02b0df2072041fe9c3b6017cf11121f4169fa2718b3801b441e056ae@[::]:30303?discport=0"`

- Before adding it to the static-nodes.json file we remove the ?discport=0 part at the end, and replace [::] with the nodes external ip address:

`"enode://750ade65e0f208aa48d9314306fe6d66ec26f83cff39ee9fbf710c1f8398b5357e2c272f02b0df2072041fe9c3b6017cf11121f4169fa2718b3801b441e056ae@[207.154.123.234]:30303"`

- We can define the nodes (peers) to connect to for every node in a config file called *static-nodes.json*.
- It has to be placed in the data directory (default: ~/.ethereum/static-nodes.json)
- It's syntax is a simple array containing the enode id's to connect to.

*static-nodes.json*   
```
[
  "enode://750ade65e0f208aa48d9314306fe6d66ec26f83cff39ee9fbf710c1f8398b5357e2c272f02b0df2072041fe9c3b6017cf11121f4169fa2718b3801b441e056ae@[207.154.123.234]:30303"
]
```

- Check that the enode line contains the target nodes IP-Address and port at the end. Verify that it is correct.

- Start up the first node (the one without a static-nodes.json)
  `./geth --networkid 1234 --nodiscover --verbosity 9 console`

- Start up the second node (with the static-nodes.json)
  `./geth --networkid 1234 --nodiscover --verbosity 9 console`

- We see log output on the first node like:   
```

      }
    }
}]
```

#### Nodes are connected! Let's try mining

- Exit the console of the second node. (exit)
- Start it again with added `--mine` flag. (You can also add `--minerthreads 1` to get a clean logflow for now)
`./geth --networkid 1234 --nodiscover --verbosity 9 --mine console`

- the mining node is only writing single lines containing:
```

```
- Check the server you are running on. Probably it's too low on memory. Try mining on a faster computer first to remove this problem.

### We have a working, private ethereum blockchain with 2 connected nodes, one of which is mining blocks!
